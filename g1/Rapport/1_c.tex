% Implement the sum function, which returns a sum of values of data in the queue, 
% and uses function pointer ∗val to get the values.
% For example, if the value function maps a to 1, b to 2, and c to 3, 
% and the queue qu contains [a,b,c] (see picture above), 
% the call sum(qu,value) will return 6. 
% Called with a constant function which always returns 1, 
% the sum function will return the queue’s length.
